        "Experiment": "1) Modify the generate method in the GPT class to implement a fixed-size cache storing recent character n-grams (n=1,2,3) and their associated hidden states. 2) Implement a compute_ngram_context function that aggregates information from the cache based on n-gram matches with the current context. 3) Update the generate method to incorporate the n-gram context when predicting the next character. 4) Train baseline models on all datasets. 5) Generate text using both standard and n-gram context-aware methods, comparing perplexity, consistency in character usage, and maintenance of rare or domain-specific terms. 6) Analyze the impact of cache size and n-gram lengths on generation quality and computational overhead. 7) Evaluate the model's ability to maintain consistent spelling of names and technical terms over long generated sequences. 8) Experiment with different methods of incorporating the n-gram context (e.g., attention mechanism, concat, or gating).",
